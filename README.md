# Bangalore Traffic Congestion Prediction

This project provides a visual representation of traffic congestion levels across different areas in Bangalore, India. It uses an interactive map to display real-time traffic data and predictions.

## Features

- Interactive map of Bangalore showing traffic congestion levels
- Color-coded markers indicating congestion severity:
  - Red: High congestion (>70%)
  - Orange: Medium congestion (50-70%)
  - Green: Low congestion (<50%)
- Detailed popup information for each location
- City-wide congestion prediction
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Areas Covered

The map includes the following major areas of Bangalore:
- Indiranagar
- Koramangala
- Electronic City
- Whitefield
- Marathahalli
- HSR Layout
- Jayanagar
- JP Nagar
- BTM Layout
- Rajajinagar

## Technical Details

The project is built using:
- Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
- Bootstrap for responsive design
- Font Awesome for icons
- CartoDB for base map tiles

## How to Use

1. Open the `bangalore_traffic_congestion_map.html` file in a web browser
2. The map will automatically center on Bangalore
3. Click on any marker to see detailed congestion information for that area

- The color of the marker indicates the current congestion level:
  - Red markers: Severe congestion (70-100%)
  - Orange markers: Moderate congestion (50-70%)
  - Green markers: Light congestion (0-50%)
- Clicking a marker shows the exact congestion percentage for that area

## Future Enhancements
